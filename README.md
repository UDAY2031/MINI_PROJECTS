# TodoList App: Flutter & DSA Integration

## Introduction

This TodoList app is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently using Flutter for the frontend and integrating both array lists and linked lists as data structures for task management. 

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Prioritize tasks based on importance or deadlines
- View tasks in a list format with details

## Installation

To use the TodoList app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the [Flutter installation instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `flutter run` to launch the app on your device or emulator.

## Usage

Once the app is installed, you can:

- Add a new task by tapping the '+' button.
- Edit a task by tapping on it.
- Mark a task as completed by tapping on the checkbox.
- Delete a task by swiping left on it.
- Prioritize tasks by rearranging them using drag-and-drop gestures.

## Data Structure Integration

The app integrates both array lists and linked lists for task management:

- **Array Lists:** Used for storing tasks and providing fast access to elements. Ideal for small to medium-sized task lists.
- **Linked Lists:** Used for efficient insertion, deletion, and rearrangement of tasks. Ideal for dynamically changing task lists with frequent updates.
